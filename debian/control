Description: Apache web server module for two-factor authentication using
 one-time passwords (HOTP/OATH).
 .
 mod_authn_otp is an Apache web server module for two-factor authentication
 using one-time passwords (OTP) generated via the HOTP/OATH algorithm defined
 in RFC 4226. This creates a simple way to protect a web site with one-time
 passwords, using any RFC 4226-compliant hardware or software token device. It
 also supports the Mobile-OTP algorithm.
 .
 Event and time based one-time passwords are supported. mod_authn_otp also
 supports "lingering" which allows the repeated re-use of a previously used
 one-time password up to a configurable maximum linger time. This allows
 one-time passwords to be used directly in HTTP authentication without forcing
 the user to enter a new one-time password for every page load.
 .
 mod_authn_otp supports both basic and digest authentication, and will
 auto-synchronize with the user's token within a configurable maximum offset
 (auto-synchronization is not supported with digest authentication).
 .
 mod_authn_otp is especially useful for setting up protected web sites that
 require more security than simple username/password authentication yet also
 don't require users to install special VPN software, and is compatible with
 software tokens that run on cell phones.
 .
 Also included is otptool, a one-time password command line utility.
